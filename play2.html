        <h6 class="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6><p class="speech">  Hum!  That is what I have come to talk to you about,
            sir.  You have got to get married, and at once.  Why, when I was your
            age, sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was
            already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.  Damme, sir, it is
            your duty to get married.  You can’t be always living for pleasure.
            Every man of position is married nowadays.  Bachelors are not fashionable
            any more.  They are a damaged lot.  Too much is known about them.  You
            must get a wife, sir.  Look where your friend Robert Chiltern has got to
            by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.  Why
            don’t you imitate him, sir?  Why don’t you take him for your model?</p> <br>
            
            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6><p class="speech">  I think I shall, father.</p> <br>
            
            <h6 class="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6><p class="speech">  I wish you would, sir.  Then I should be happy.  At
            present I make your mother’s life miserable on your account.  You are
            heartless, sir, quite heartless.</p> <br>
