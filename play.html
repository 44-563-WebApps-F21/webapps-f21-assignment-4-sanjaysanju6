            _The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
            the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
            smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
            drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
            some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
            impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
            Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
            intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
            the dominance of form_

        <p>LORD GORING.  During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the
            first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven.<br>
            
            <br>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday.<br>
            
            <br>LORD GORING.  But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I must
            not have any serious conversation after seven.  It makes me talk in my
            sleep.<br>
            
            <br>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Talk in your sleep, sir?  What does that matter?  You
            are not married.<br>
            
            <br>LORD GORING.  No, father, I am not married.<br>
            
            <br>LORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  That is what I have come to talk to you about,
            sir.  You have got to get married, and at once.  Why, when I was your
            age, sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was
            already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.  Damme, sir, it is
            your duty to get married.  You can’t be always living for pleasure.
            Every man of position is married nowadays.  Bachelors are not fashionable
            any more.  They are a damaged lot.  Too much is known about them.  You
            must get a wife, sir.  Look where your friend Robert Chiltern has got to
            by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.  Why
            don’t you imitate him, sir?  Why don’t you take him for your model?<br>
            
            <br>LORD GORING.  I think I shall, father.<br>
            
            <br>LORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would, sir.  Then I should be happy.  At
            present I make your mother’s life miserable on your account.  You are
            heartless, sir, quite heartless.<br>
            
            <br>LORD GORING.  I hope not, father.<br>
